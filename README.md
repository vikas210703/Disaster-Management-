**Project Overview**
This project focuses on disaster response analysis using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model development to classify disaster-related messages.

**Files in the Repository**
•	Disaster.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with initial data exploration and model development.
•	Disaster2.ipynb: Further enhancements to the model and additional preprocessing steps.
•	Disaster3.ipynb: Final implementation and model evaluation.
•	Final report Dip.pdf: Detailed project report with methodology and results.

**Requirements**
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk

**How to Run**
1.	Clone this repository: 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Disaster-Response.git
cd Disaster-Response
2.	Open and run the Jupyter notebooks 
3.	Follow the steps in Disaster3.ipynb for final model evaluation.
	
**Results**
•	Successfully classified disaster-related messages.
•	Improved accuracy using text preprocessing and feature engineering.
•	Detailed findings are available in Final report Dip.pdf.

**Future Work**
•	Deploy the model using a web application.
•	Improve classification performance with deep learning techniques.
